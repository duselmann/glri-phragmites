  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p style="margin-top: 0px">  
  Assessment and management of pesticides require far more information than we can 
  afford to directly measure for all the places, times, and pesticides of interest. 
  In addition, many decisions-such as setting monitoring priorities, approving 
  registration of a new pesticide, and determining how much to spend on a 
  management strategy-inherently depend on predicting the potential effects of 
  pesticides on water quality for locations or amounts of use that have never been 
  directly assessed. In these situations, statistical models and other types of 
  models are used for predicting water-quality conditions at unmonitored locations 
  under a range of possible circumstances. The <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa" target="_blank">National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program</a> 
  is developing a series of statistical models, based on monitoring data and 
  watershed characteristics, to enable estimation of pesticide concentrations for 
  streams that have not been monitored.  The

  <span class="bold-underline">P</span>esticides models 
  are referred to as WARP models. The first completed WARP model is for atrazine, one of the most heavily used

  <h1>What is Atrazine?</h1>
  <p>
  Atrazine is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the United States. Most 
  agricultural use is associated with corn production-about 85 percent of 75 
  million lbs/yr in 1997.  Atrazine has relatively low and poorly quantified 
  nonagricultural use-estimated at less than 1 million lbs/yr (USEPA, 2003a). 
  Nonagricultural uses include conifer forestry, Christmas tree farms, sod, golf 
  courses, and residential lawns (particularly in the South). Atrazine is highly 
  soluble and mobile in water and relatively long-lived, with a soil half-life of 
  146 days.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Concentrations of atrazine in agricultural streams generally conform to the 
  geographic distribution of corn cultivation, where applications are greatest 
  (Figure 2). Atrazine is also frequently detected in urban streams, but usually 
  at substantially lower concentrations compared with agricultural streams that 
  are located in areas of high atrazine use (some urban streams in parts of the 
  South where atrazine is used on turf grasses have relatively high concentrations). 
  Concentrations in streams draining watersheds with mixed land use tend to 
  resemble those in agricultural streams because many of these streams have 
  watersheds with relatively high proportions of agricultural land.

  <h1>How was the Model Developed?</h1>
  <p>
  The WARP models for pesticides are developed using linear regression methods to 
  establish quantitative linkages between pesticide concentrations measured at 
  NAWQA sampling sites and a variety of human-related and natural factors that 
  affect pesticides in streams. Such factors include pesticide use, soil 
  characteristics, hydrology, and climate-collectively referred to as explanatory 
  variables. Measured pesticide concentrations, together with the associated 
  values of the explanatory variables for the sampling sites, comprise the 
  model-development data.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The WARP model for estimating atrazine in streams is based on concentrations 
  measured by NAWQA from 1992 to 2001 at 112 stream sites (Figure 3). The single 
  most complete year of data was used to calculate concentration statistics for 
  each site.  The atrazine model actually consists of a series of models, each 
  developed for a specific concentration statistic.
  </p>
  
   
  <p>
  <img src="assets/images/figure2.PNG" alt="figure 3"/><br/>
  <b>Figure 3.</b>  <i>Stream sites included in model development.</i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The models are built using the explanatory variables that best correlate with, 
  or explain, the concentration statistics computed from concentrations observed 
  in streams. Although explanatory variables included in the models are 
  significantly correlated with pesticide concentrations, the specific 
  cause-and-effect relations responsible for the observed correlations are not 
  always clear, and inferences regarding causes should be considered as 
  hypotheses.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In developing the models, all potential explanatory variables were required to 
  have values available from existing data sources that include all locations in 
  the conterminous United States, so that national extrapolation would be possible. 
  About 43 possible variables were considered and these were reduced to 6 
  explanatory variables that were most significant and yielded optimal model 
  formulations. Each model incorporates an uncertainty analysis, which allows 
  assessment of the reliability of the model predictions and also the expression 
  of model predictions as probabilities that concentrations will exceed a specific 
  value, such as a water-quality benchmark, at a particular location.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Atrazine use intensity is the most important factor in the model that explains 
  atrazine concentrations in streams-the more intensive the use of atrazine in a 
  watershed, the higher the atrazine concentration in the stream. Specifically, 
  estimated atrazine use intensity within each watershed explains 68 percent of 
  the variance in annual mean atrazine concentrations. Four additional variables 
  explain another 14 percent of the variability, most of which is accounted for by 
  precipitation during May and June of the sampling year and rainfall erosivity 
  and soil erodibility-factors used in the revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 
  (Renard and others, 1997). For the most of the model development sites, the 
  months of April through June include the highest atrazine application period. 
  High precipitation during May and June, after atrazine application, increases 
  atrazine runoff to streams.  Rainfall erosivity and soil 
  erodibility quantify, respectively, the energy of storms in a specific area 
  (averaged over several years), and the susceptibility of soils to erosion by 
  runoff. As these two factors increase, atrazine concentrations also increase, 
  indicating that transport of atrazine is highest in areas of high-energy rain 
  storms and in areas where soils are most susceptible to erosion. Alternatively, 
  soil erodibility may indicate high surface runoff, rather than actual transport 
  of atrazine with soil particles. Overall, the complete model explains a total of 
  82 percent of the variance in observed annual mean atrazine concentrations.

  <h1>What does the Model Predict?</h1>
  <p>
	The atrazine models included for use on this web site to create maps and graphs
	 are the models for the annual mean, annual modeled maximum, annual modeled maximum 
	 moving averages (21-, 60-, and 90-day durations) and the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 
	 95th percentiles of annual concentration; models for other percentiles are included 
	 in Stone and Gilliom (2009). For each of these annual concentration statistics, the 
	 models can be used to estimate the value for a particular stream, including 
	 confidence bounds on the estimate, or the probability that a particular value will 
	 be exceeded, such as a water-quality benchmark. Each of these options for applying 
	 the model has advantages for specific purposes. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The modeled maximum concentration is expected to under predict the true annual 
  maximum concentration.  The sampling frequencies of the model devlopment sites 
  were not sufficient to characterize the true annual maximum concentrations 
  <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1186/" target="_blank">(Stone and others, 2008)</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  When used to estimate the value of a concentration statistic for a stream, 
  such as the mean or 95th percentile, the model computes the median estimate 
  of the statistic for all streams with watershed characteristics that are similar 
  to the stream in question. Thus, the computed estimate for a particular stream 
  has an equal chance of being above or below the actual value of the statistic. 
  The confidence that the estimated value is within a certain magnitude of the 
  actual value is indicated by the 95-percent confidence limits, which encompass 
  95 percent of the actual values associated with the predicted value.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  When used to estimate the probability that a particular stream has an atrazine 
  concentration greater than a specific threshold, usually a water-quality 
  benchmark, the model prediction and uncertainty are combined to estimate the 
  probability for the stream.

  <h1>How are Predictions Made?</h1>  
  <p>
  Model estimates can be made for either concentration values or probabilities 
  for most stream reaches included in the USEPA River Reach file (Nolan and 
  others, 2003), which include more than 600,000 miles of streams and more than 
  60,000 individual stream reaches with watersheds. The term "stream" refers to 
  all River Reach file segments, regardless of drainage basin area. Model 
  development stations spanned over 5 orders of magnitude in terms of watershed 
  area and model predictions are not biased with respect to watershed area.  
  However, model estimates are not made available for streams with watersheds 
  smaller than 75 square kilometers because of the high potential uncertainty 
  in explanatory variables, such as pesticide use, for small watersheds.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In addition to streams, River Reach file segments may actually represent 
  reservoirs.  The atrazine regression models were developed with stream 
  (flowing water) data to predict concentration distributions in streams.  The 
  application of these regression models to lakes and reservoirs will provide 
  under predicted concentrations for the annual mean and the annual percentiles 
  <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri034047/" target="_blank">(Larson and others, 2004)</a>.  
 Model estimates are not made available for River Reach file segments that represent reservoirs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Annual agricultural pesticide use estimates were developed using annual pesticide 
  use data for individual crops for multi-county areas referred to as <i>Crop 
  Reporting Districts</i> (CRDs) (proprietary data, dmrkynetec, Inc., St.Louis, 
  Missouri) and county-level annual harvested acres of individual crops from either
   the U.S. Department of Agriculture Census of Agriculture or annual survey data 
   for major crops.  The CRD-level use estimates for each crop were disaggregated 
   to county-level use estimates by dividing the mass of a pesticide applied to a 
   crop by the acres of that crop in the CRD to yield a rate per harvested acre. 
   This rate was then multiplied by harvested crop acreages in each county to obtain 
   county-level use.  The county-level pesticide use estimates for the U.S. were 
   then combined with national land cover data to generate a raster dataset of 
   pesticide use intensity, following the method described in 
   <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1188/" target="_blank">Nakagaki and Wolock 
   (2005)</a>. 
  </p>
  
  
  <p class="faq-section">
  Estimating atrazine concentrations for the roughly 60,000 stream reaches 
  required that regression predictor variables be calculated for the entire 
  basin draining to the downstream end of each stream reach. For example, the 
  predictor variables for the stream reach at the mouth of the Mississippi River 
  are based on the chemical and physical characteristics of the entire upstream 
  river basin. The process of computing the explanatory variables incorporated 
  several steps. For illustration, the steps below describe the process for 
  calculating atrazine use intensity. The required geographic data include a 
  raster dataset of atrazine use intensity for the conterminous U.S., the River 
  Reach file, and a raster dataset of incremental catchments, which are the 
  local drainage areas of all headwater streams, tributary streams, and stream 
  segments lying between confluences. The processing steps are:
  <ol>
  <li>The incremental catchments are intersected with the atrazine use intensity 
  grid to compute atrazine use in each incremental catchment.
  </li>
  <li>The known association between the individual stream reaches and 
  corresponding incremental catchments is used to assign incremental atrazine 
  use values to each stream reach. Similarly, the correspondence between the 
  individual stream reaches and the incremental catchments is used to assign 
  incremental drainage area values to each stream reach.
  </li>
  <li>The topology (spatial connections) of the stream network is used to 
  accumulate, in a downstream direction, all the incremental atrazine use 
  values. This accumulation provides an estimate of total basin atrazine use 
  for each stream reach. Similarly, the incremental drainage areas are 
  accumulated in a downstream direction to estimate the total drainage area for 
  each stream reach. 
  </li>
  <li>The total basin atrazine use is divided by the total drainage area to 
  calculate the atrazine use intensity for each stream reach.
  </li>

  <h1>What are Some Examples of WARP Predictions?</h1>
  <p>
  Figure 4 shows predicted annual mean concentrations for 2007. Model predictions of 
  atrazine levels in streams across the Nation show the highest annual mean 
  concentrations throughout the high-use areas of the Corn Belt and the 
  Mississippi Valley and Delta regions, and in some areas of Texas, Pennsylvania, 
  and Maryland.  Annual means for a few streams in Missouri, Kansas, and Texas are 
predicted to exceed 3 ug/L, the 
  human-health benchmark for atrazine. This benchmark is the USEPA MCL for 
  drinking water. As a drinking-water standard, the MCL applies to finished 
  drinking water in public water supplies, whereas the predictions are for 
  untreated stream water. Comparisons of model predictions with human-health 
  benchmarks, however, serve as a screening-level assessment of the suitability of 
  potential drinking-water sources.

  Figure 5 shows the probability that streams will exceed the 3 ug/L 
benchmark. The streams with a greater than 5-percent probability of 
  exceeding the benchmark represent about 6 percent of the Nation's stream miles 
  (36,829 of 649,935 mi). Approximately 546 stream miles (less than 1/10th of 1 
  percent of the Nation's stream miles) are predicted to have more than a 
  50-percent probability of exceeding 3 ug/L.

  <h1>How Can WARP be Used to Assess the Potential for Effects of Pesticides on Humans or Aquatic Life?</h1>
  <p>
  The potential for pesticide concentrations in stream water to adversely 
  affect human health or aquatic life is evaluated by NAWQA using 
  screening-level assessments (Gilliom and others, 2006) similar in concept to 
  USEPA screening-level assessments (USEPA, 2004d). The NAWQA screening-level 
  assessments compare site-specific estimates of pesticide exposure (
  concentration statistics or concentrations) with water-quality benchmarks 
  derived from standards and guidelines established by USEPA, toxicity values 
  from USEPA pesticide risk assessments, and USGS Health-Based Screening Levels
  (HBSLs). The USEPA standards, guidelines, and toxicity values were developed
  by USEPA as part of the Federal process for assessing and regulating 
  pesticides.
  </p>
  <p>
  Screening-level assessments are not a substitute for either risk assessments, 
  which include many more factors (such as additional avenues of exposure), or 
  site-specific studies of effects. Rather, comparisons of measured or 
  estimated concentrations with water-quality benchmarks provide a perspective 
  on the potential for adverse effects, as well as a framework for prioritizing
  additional investigations that may be warranted. Concentrations that exceed a
  benchmark do not necessarily indicate that adverse effects are occurring-they
  indicate that adverse effects may occur and that sites where benchmarks are
  exceeded may merit further investigation.  The characteristics and limitations
  of screening-level assessments are summarized below.
  <p>
  <h2>Characteristics and Limitations of Screening-Level Assessments</h2>
  <p>
  Screening-level assessments are a first step toward addressing the question of 
  whether or not pesticides are present at concentrations that may affect human 
  health or aquatic life. They provide a perspective on where effects are most 
  likely to occur and what pesticides may be responsible. Screening-level 
  assessments are primarily intended to identify and prioritize needs for 
  further investigation and have the following characteristics and limitations: 
  <ul>
    <li>Most water-quality benchmarks selected for the screening-level
    assessment are estimates of no-effect levels, such that concentrations below 
    the benchmarks are expected to have a low likelihood of adverse effects and
    concentrations above a benchmark have a greater likelihood of adverse 
    effects, which generally increases with concentration.</li>
    <li>The presence of pesticides in streams at concentrations that exceed 
    benchmarks does not indicate that adverse effects are certain to occur. 
    Conversely, concentrations that are below benchmarks do not guarantee that
    adverse effects will not occur, but indicate that they are expected to be 
    negligible (subject to limitations of concentration estimates and 
    benchmarks).</li>
    <li>Most water-quality benchmarks for pesticides are based on toxicity tests 
    of individual chemicals, whereas pesticides usually occur as mixtures.
    Comparisons to single-compound benchmarks may tend to underestimate the 
    potential for adverse effects.</li>
    <li>Water-quality benchmarks for different pesticides and media are not 
    always comparable because they have been derived by a number of different 
    approaches, using a variety of types of toxicity values and test species.
    </li>
    <li>For some benchmarks, there is substantial uncertainty in underlying 
    estimates of no-effect levels, depending on the methods used to derive them
    and the quantity and types of toxicity information on which they are based.
    </li>
    <li>Estimates of pesticide exposure derived from either measured or 
    estimated concentrations are also uncertain-particularly estimates of 
    short-term exposure of aquatic organisms to pesticides in stream water.</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2>Human-Health Benchmarks for Pesticides in Water</h2>
  <p>
  Benchmarks for assessing the potential for pesticides in water to affect human
  health are USEPA Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for regulated compounds,
  and USGS Health-Based Screening Levels (HBSLs) for unregulated compounds.  
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)</b> - The maximum permissible concentration 
  of a contaminant in water that is delivered to any user of a public water 
  system. This is an enforceable standard issued by USEPA under the Safe 
  Drinking Water Act and established on the basis of health effects and other 
  factors (analytical and treatment technologies, and cost).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Health-Based Screening Level (HBSL)</b> - HBSLs are concentrations or 
  ranges in concentration (for carcinogens) that can be used as benchmarks to 
  which contaminant concentrations in water can be compared to evaluate 
  water-quality data in a human-health context. HBSLs were developed 
  collaboratively by the USGS, U.S. EPA, New Jersey Department of Environmental 
  Protection, and Oregon Health & Science University  (Toccalino and others, 
  2003, 2004).  HBSLs are not regulatory standards, are not enforceable, and 
  water systems are not required to monitor for any unregulated compounds for 
  which HBSLs have been developed. HBSL values are developed by using USEPA 
  Office of Water methodologies and USEPA toxicity values, so they generally are
  comparable to USEPA drinking-water guideline values such as lifetime health 
  advisory levels and risk-specific dose values (Toccalino and others, 2004). 
  Compounds with existing UPEPA USEPA drinking-water guideline values such as 
  lifetime health advisory levels or a risk specific dose are included as HBSLs.
  </p>

  <h2>Aquatic-Life Benchmarks for Pesticides in Water </h2>
  <p>
  Benchmarks for assessing the potential for pesticides in stream water to 
  adversely affect aquatic life were of two general types: (1) ambient 
  water-quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life (AWQC-AL), which
  were developed by USEPA's Office of Water (OW), and (2) benchmarks derived 
  from toxicity values obtained from registration and risk-assessment documents
  developed by USEPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP). Toxicity data from 
  OPP documents were used to supplement OW criteria to expand the coverage of 
  pesticides and to incorporate the most recent toxicity information used by 
  USEPA.  The following is summarized from Gilliom and others (2006), which 
  contains complete sources, references, and values.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Ambient Water-Quality Criteria for Aquatic Organisms</h2>
  <p>
  USEPA's OW derives both acute and chronic criteria, each of which specifies a 
  threshold concentration for unacceptable potential for effects, an averaging
  period, and an acceptable frequency of exceedances. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Acute AWQC-AL</b> - The highest concentration of a chemical to which an 
  aquatic community can be exposed briefly without resulting in an unacceptable 
  effect. Except where a locally important species is very sensitive, aquatic 
  organisms should not be unacceptably affected if the 1-hour average 
  concentration does not exceed the acute criterion more than once every 3 
  years, on average. The intent is to protect 95 percent of a diverse group of
  organisms. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Chronic AWQC-AL</b> - The highest concentration of a chemical to which an 
  aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an 
  unacceptable effect. Except where a locally important species is very 
  sensitive, aquatic organisms should not be unacceptably affected if the 4-day 
  average concentration does not exceed the chronic criterion more than once 
  every 3 years, on average. The intent is to protect 95 percent of a diverse 
  group of organisms. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Toxicity Values from Risk Assessments</h2>
  <p>Seven types of aquatic toxicity values were compiled from OPP's 
  registration and risk-assessment documents. The OPP toxicity values are for
  specific types of organisms. Acute and chronic values were compiled for fish 
  and invertebrates, and acute values for vascular and nonvascular plants. A 
  value for aquatic-community effects was available only for atrazine. The 
  types and amounts of toxicity data available for different pesticides were 
  highly variable. USEPA estimates the toxicity or hazard of a pesticide by
  selecting the most sensitive endpoints from multiple acute and chronic 
  laboratory and field studies. For many pesticides, USEPA has completed a 
  screening-level ecological risk assessment, which includes acute and chronic 
  assessments for both fish and invertebrates. For some pesticides, acute 
  assessments have also been completed for nontarget aquatic plants. NAWQA 
  derived benchmarks from OPP toxicity values, generally following OPP 
  procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
  In recent years, USEPA has developed methods for conducting refined risk
  assessments, in which probabilistic tools and methods are incorporated to 
  predict the magnitude of the expected impact of pesticide use on nontarget 
  organisms, as well as the uncertainty and variability involved in these 
  estimates. The screening-level benchmarks used in NAWQA analysis and 
  summarized below were derived from the toxicity values reported in USEPA 
  registration and risk-assessment documents. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In the few cases where refined assessments were available, these were given 
  preference. In deriving a benchmark for a given type of organism (such as 
  fish) and a given exposure duration (acute or chronic), the lowest of the 
  available toxicity values was selected for each benchmark, unless a preferred
  toxicity value was specified in a refined risk assessment-in which case that 
  preferred toxicity value was used instead. For two of the 
  benchmarks-acute-fish and acute-invertebrates-the selected toxicity values 
  were multiplied by the USEPA level of concern (LOC) of 0.5, so that the 
  benchmark for NAWQA screening corresponds to the acute risk level defined by 
  USEPA. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Six benchmarks were based directly on toxicity endpoints used in OPP 
  screening-level assessments:
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Acute fish</b> - The lowest tested 50-percent lethal concentration (LC50) 
  for acute (typically 96-hour) toxicity tests with freshwater fish, multiplied 
  by the LOC of 0.5.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Acute invertebrate</b> - The lowest tested LC50 or 50-percent effect 
  concentration (EC50) for acute (typically 48 or 96-hour) toxicity tests with 
  freshwater invertebrates, multiplied by the LOC of 0.5.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Acute vascular plant</b> - The lowest tested EC50 for freshwater vascular 
  plants in acute toxicity tests (typically < 10 days).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Acute nonvascular plant</b> - The lowest tested EC50 for freshwater 
  nonvascular plants (algae) in acute toxicity tests (typically < 10 days). 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Chronic fish</b> - The lowest no-observed-adverse-effects concentration 
  (NOAEC), or the lowest-observed-adverse-effects concentration (LOAEC) if a 
  NOAEC is not available, for freshwater fish in early lifestage or full 
  life-cycle tests. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Chronic invertebrate</b> - The lowest NOAEC, or LOAEC if a NOAEC is not 
  available, for freshwater invertebrates in life-cycle tests.
  </p>
  <p>
  One additional benchmark, a benchmark for aquatic-community effects, was 
  derived from the refined risk assessment for atrazine. This endpoint for 
  atrazine incorporates community-level effects on aquatic plants and indirect 
  effects on fish and aquatic invertebrates that could result from disturbance 
  of the plant community.

      <b>Assessment of geographic patterns in stream concentrations of atrazine 
      at scales ranging from national to watershed</b><br/>The WARP model is 
      well suited for characterizing broad geographic patterns in stream 
      concentrations resulting from agricultural applications of atrazine.  
      Broad patterns for regional, State, or multi-county areas are generally 
      reliable for representing the proportions of streams in different 
      concentration categories, but the uncertainty is relatively high in 
      predictions for specific individual streams.  For specific streams, it is 
      important for users to evaluate the prediction graph provided for each 
      individual site, which shows all estimated concentration statistics with 
      95% prediction intervals.
      </li>
      <li>
      <b>Design of monitoring programs and studies</b><br/>One of the most 
      appropriate and useful applications of WARP is to prioritize the needs 
      for monitoring of specific streams, generally targeting those that have 
      high predicted concentrations.   By this approach, scarce monitoring 
      resources can be targeted to the streams where the potential for concern 
      is greatest.

      <li>
      <b>Identification of streams with the greatest likelihood to have 
      concentrations that exceed a water-quality benchmark</b><br/>Streams with 
      the greatest likelihood of exceeding a human-health benchmark would be 
      those of greatest potential concern if considered as a source of drinking 
      water.  Streams with the greatest likelihood of exceeding an aquatic-life 
      benchmark would be the sites where related biological effects are most 
      likely and may merit investigation.  The probability estimates by WARP 
      incorporate the influence of predictive uncertainty.

      <b>Education about the distribution of atrazine in streams and the 
      watershed characteristics that control its concentrations</b><br/>The 
      interactive mapping of model results is designed to be an educational tool 
      that can be used to explore estimated concentrations in different 
      geographic areas in relation to such factors as land use and pesticide use 
      in stream watersheds.

  <h1>What are the Limitations of WARP?</h1>
  <p>
    The WARP model for atrazine has several limitations and constraints that are 
    important to understand when applying the model and its results:
    <ul>
      <li>
The sampling frequencies of the model-development sites were not sufficient to 
reliably characterize the highest concentrations during a year. Thus, application 
of the models to predict the annual maximum concentration is expected to 
underpredict the actual annual maximums.
      </li>
      <li>
The WARP regression models were derived for estimation of atrazine concentrations 
in rivers and streams of the conterminous United States. While the 112 stations 
used for model development represent a wide variety of environmental settings and 
a large range of watershed area, some watersheds in the United States have one 
or more characteristics outside the ranges of the watershed characteristics used 
to develop the models. Application of the models to streams draining such 
watersheds would result in increased uncertainty in predicted concentrations. 
      </li>
      <li>
The models were developed using data from flowing streams and rivers. Application 
to lakes or reservoirs would likely result in biased predictions (Larson and others, 2004).
      </li>
      <li>
The atrazine use data used for the models are estimates for agricultural applications 
to cropland only. Nonagricultural use of atrazine in a watershed, if significant, 
could result in inaccurate (low) predictions of atrazine concentrations in a stream. 
      </li>
      <li>
The atrazine WARP model is an empirical model based only on nationally available data 
sets. The model does not include and did not evaluate factors for which there are no 
national data. Examples are management practices, such as buffer strips and herbicide 
application methods.
