<label for="rad_mcl">1.  Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL):  3 &mu;g/L</label>
</h3>



<p> 
<b>Benchmark Description:</b>  The MCL is the maximum permissible concentration 
of atrazine in water that is delivered to any user of a public water system. 
This is an enforceable standard issued by USEPA under the Safe Drinking Water 
Act and established on the basis of health effects and other factors (analytical 
and treatment technologies, and cost).  Compliance of public water supplies is 
generally assessed by comparing annual mean concentrations determined from 
quarterly monitoring to the MCL.  The underlying health-risk assessment is based 
on lifetime exposure.
</p>

<p>
<b>WARP Statistic for Comparison:</b>  Annual mean concentration.  The annual 
mean concentration is the appropriate concentration statistic to compare to 
human-health benchmarks that are based on long-term, lifetime exposure.
</p>

<p>
<b>Interpretation and Limitations:</b>  The MCL applies to finished drinking 
water (post treatment) rather than raw source water and, thus, source water 
concentrations estimated by WARP for streams that are public water supply 
sources may tend to over estimate concentrations for public water systems that 
use treatment processes that reduce atrazine concentrations.  In addition, most 
streams in the U.S. are not presently used as sources of drinking water and, 
thus, the MCL comparisons for these streams do not indicate the current level of 
concern, but the degree of potential concern if they should be considered as 
future sources.

<label for="rad_dwloc_95">2. Drinking Water Level of Comparison (DWLOC):  12.5 &mu;g/L</label>
</h3>
<p> 
<b>Benchmark Description:  </b>The DWLOC is the 90-day moving average 
concentration in untreated source water that, if exceeded, indicates USEPA 
concern and may lead to increased monitoring requirements (USEPA, 2003).  The 
DWLOC for atrazine applies to "total chlorotriazines" (TCT), which includes 
atrazine plus its chlorinated metabolites.
</p>

<p>
<b>WARP Statistic for Comparison:</b> Modeled maximum 90-day moving-average concentrations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Interpretation and Limitations:</b>  Atrazine concentration, other factors being 
equal, is an underestimate of TCT, however, because atrazine is only one component 
of TCT and one or more atrazine metabolites are usually present when atrazine is 
present. The DWLOC applies to raw source water for public water supply sources. 
Most streams in the U.S. are not presently used as sources of drinking water. 
Benchmark comparisons for streams that are not sources of drinking water indicate 
the degree of potential concern, if they should be considered as future sources.

<h2>Aquatic-Life Benchmarks</h2>
<p>
Benchmarks for assessing the potential for atrazine in stream water to adversely 
affect aquatic life are of two general types: (1) ambient water-quality criteria 
for the protection of aquatic life (AWQC-AL), which were developed by USEPA's 
Office of Water (OW), and (2) benchmarks derived from toxicity values obtained 
from registration and risk-assessment documents developed by USEPA's Office of 
Pesticide Programs (OPP).
</p>


<h3>Ambient Water-Quality Criteria for Aquatic Organisms</h3>
<p>
USEPA's OW derives both acute and chronic criteria, each of which specifies 
a threshold concentration for unacceptable potential for effects, an averaging 
period, and an acceptable frequency of exceedances.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acute AWQC-AL-</b>The highest concentration of a chemical to which an aquatic 
community can be exposed briefly without resulting in an unacceptable effect. 
Except where a locally important species is very sensitive, aquatic organisms 
should not be unacceptably affected if the 1-hour average concentration does not 
exceed the acute criterion more than once every 3 years, on average. The intent 
is to protect 95 percent of a diverse group of organisms. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Chronic AWQC-AL-</b>The highest concentration of a chemical to which an 
aquatic community can be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an 
unacceptable effect. Except where a locally important species is very sensitive, 
aquatic organisms should not be unacceptably affected if the 4-day average 
concentration does not exceed the chronic criterion more than once every 3 
years, on average. The intent is to protect 95 percent of a diverse group of 
organisms. 
</p>

<h3>Toxicity Values from Risk Assessments</h3>
<p>
Seven types of aquatic toxicity values were compiled from OPP's registration and 
risk-assessment documents. The OPP toxicity values are for specific types of 
organisms. Acute and chronic values were compiled for fish and invertebrates, 
and acute values for vascular and nonvascular plants. A value for 
aquatic-community effects was available only for atrazine. NAWQA derived the 
benchmarks from OPP toxicity values, generally following OPP procedures.
For two of the benchmarks-acute-fish and acute-invertebrates-the selected 
toxicity values were multiplied by the USEPA level of concern (LOC) of 0.5, so 
that the benchmark for NAWQA screening corresponds to the acute risk level 
defined by USEPA.  Each benchmark is described below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Acute fish-</b> The lowest tested 50-percent lethal concentration (LC50) for 
acute (typically 96-hour) toxicity tests with freshwater fish, multiplied by the 
LOC of 0.5.
</p>
<p>
<b>Acute invertebrate-</b> The lowest tested LC50 or 50-percent effect 
concentration (EC50) for acute (typically 48 or 96-hour) toxicity tests with 
freshwater invertebrates, multiplied by the LOC of 0.5.
</p>
<p>
<b>Acute vascular plant-</b> The lowest tested EC50 for freshwater vascular 
plants in acute toxicity tests (typically < 10 days).
</p>
<p>
<b>Acute nonvascular plant-</b> The lowest tested EC50 for freshwater 
nonvascular plants (algae) in acute toxicity tests (typically < 10 days). 
</p>
<p>
<b>Chronic fish-</b> The lowest no-observed-adverse-effects concentration 
(NOAEC), or the lowest-observed-adverse-effects concentration (LOAEC) if a NOAEC 
is not available, for freshwater fish in early lifestage or full life-cycle
tests. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Chronic invertebrate-</b> The lowest NOAEC, or LOAEC if a NOAEC is not 
available, for freshwater invertebrates in life-cycle tests.
</p>
<p>
<b>Aquatic community effects-</b> The benchmark for aquatic-community effects 
was derived from the refined risk assessment for atrazine. This endpoint for 
atrazine incorporates community-level effects on aquatic plants and indirect 
effects on fish and aquatic invertebrates that could result from disturbance of 
the plant community.

<b>Benchmark Description:</b>  As described above, each acute benchmark for 
atrazine is based on short-term toxicity tests and pertains to short-term 
environmental exposure such as indicated by the modeled maximum concentration of atrazine.
</p>

<p>
<b>WARP Statistic for Comparison:</b>  Modeled maximum concentration.
</p>

<p>
<b>Interpretation and Limitations:</b>  The maximum observed atrazine 
concentrations in the WARP model development data are underestimates of 
actual maximums because the sampling frequencies were too sparse to yield 
a high probability of sampling short-lived conditions. Therefore, the 
WARP-estimated probability that the modeled maximum atrazine concentration 
exceeds a particular acute benchmark is an underestimate of the actual 
probability.
